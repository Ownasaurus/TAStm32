# TAStm32
Please see the "Projects" section for an overview of the current status of this project!

Please see the "Wiki" section for the technical details of the serial communication protocol!

### Overview

This project aims to create an easy-to-use, multi-system TAS replay device to be used on actual consoles. The name of this project comes from the fact that it is powered by a STM32F4 microcontroller.
